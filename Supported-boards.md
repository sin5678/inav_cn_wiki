### Boards based on F1 CPUs

These boards are not recommended for new setups. They are very limited in memory and don't support many features of the INAV. In general F1 boards are limited to only UBLOX GPS protocol, don't have BLHeli Passthrough, don't have LEDSTRIP, only support a few felemetries (LTM and maybe FrSky) etc.

### Boards based on F3/F4/F7 CPUs

These boards are powerfull and in general support everything INAV is capable of. Limitations are qute rate and are usually caused by hardware design issues.

### Boards documentation

See the [docs](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/tree/master/docs) folder for addiotional infomation regards to many targets in INAV, to example help in finding pinout and features.  
_Feel free to help improve the docs._

### Sponsored and recommended boards

These boards come from companies that support INAV development. Buying one of these boards you make your small contribution for improving INAV as well. 

Also these boards are tested by INAV development team and usually flown on daily basis.
